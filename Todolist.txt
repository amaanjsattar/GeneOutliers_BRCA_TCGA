+ Outlier Gene Expression in Cancer

	1. Starting with prostate cancer, understand really weird gene expression outliers
		○ Data set
			▪ CPC-GENE RNA-seq data : normalized by FPKM
			▪ TCGA Prostate Cancer RNA-seq data : normalized by FPKM
			▪ SU2C RNA-seq data : normalized by FPKM
		○ Define "really weird" genes with for each transcript
			▪ Use mean and SD
			▪ Use mean and SD excluding zero values
			▪ Use median and MAD 
			▪ Use median and MAD excluding zero values
			▪ Use trimmed mean and trimmed SD
			▪ Use trimmed mean and trimmed SD excluding zero values
			▪ Use K mean cluster
			▪ Use K mean cluster excluding zero values
		○ Calculate the z-score and filter the genes by the range of z-score (max Z – min Z for that gene, across patients)
			▪ Make heatmap for each methods
				□ In z-score space
				□ In FPKM space
			▪ Make waterfall plot with z-score and FPKM value with showing the fraction of patients in which a gene is detected
			▪ Do a direct comparison amongst four methods and make correlation plot (use Spearman correlation)
		○ Make consensus clustering with top 200 outliers by the union of three methods (mean, median trimmed mean)
			▪ Consensus clustering doesn't look promising
		○ Check the reproducibility: check the correlation of z-score range between CPC-gene and TCGA-PC data set
			▪ Show high reproducibility between CPC-gene and TCGA-PC data set
			▪ Will check with SU2C data set
		○ Sort genes by their chromosome position
			▪ Make heatmap for each chromosome with z-score
			▪ See if that reveals any trends such as CNAs or enhancer changes
		○ Create an R package of functions for outlier detection
			▪ Function for calculating z-score from each methods
			▪ Function  for k mean cluster (k =2)
			▪ Function for calculating z-score range
			▪ Function for calculating k mean fraction
			▪ Function for making heatmap in z-score and FPKM space
			▪ Function for making waterfall plot of z-score and FPKM
			▪ Function for making heatmap for each chromosomal position
		○ Check for enrichment in specific pathways (g:Profiler)
		○ Check to see what the best hits with very low (i.e. negative) z-scores
		
			
	2. Quantify different mechanisms by which this can happen
	▪ enhancer hijacking
	▪ copy-neutral SVs (translocations, inversions)
	▪ non-coding SNVs & indels
	▪ extrachromosomal DNA
	▪ synonymous SNVs for protein abundance?
	▪ associations with high miRNA, circRNA, m6A features
